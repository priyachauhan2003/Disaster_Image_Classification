# Disaster Image Classification Model

This project implements a machine learning model that classifies disaster-related images into various categories such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and other natural disasters. The model helps in automating the process of disaster image categorization for faster disaster response and management.

## Features

- **Multi-Class Image Classification**: Classifies images into categories such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, etc.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Uses CNN for feature extraction and classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Supports transfer learning with pretrained models like ResNet, VGG, and Inception.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Classify disaster images through a web interface by uploading an image.
- **Performance Metrics**: Reports model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required dependencies using the ```bash requirements.txt ``` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Main Dependencies:
* TensorFlow/Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* Flask/FastAPI (for web interface)
* Pillow (for image processing)

## Dataset
The model is trained on disaster-related images categorized into disaster types such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and others. You can use public datasets like:

* Disaster Response Images Dataset
* Kaggle Disaster Dataset

Ensure that your dataset is structured into subfolders for each class (e.g., floods, earthquakes, wildfires).

## Usage
**1. Training :** Train the model on the provided dataset.

**2. Evaluation :** Test the model on test images and view performance metrics.

**3. Web App :** Use the web interface to classify disaster images in real time.

## Future Improvements
* **Model Optimization:** Experiment with different CNN architectures to improve accuracy.
* **Data Augmentation:** Apply techniques such as flipping, rotation, and zooming for better generalization.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the model to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure for wider use.
* **Integration:** Integrate with real-world disaster management systems for better responsiveness.
